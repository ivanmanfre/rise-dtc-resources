# Return Rate Rescue

**You paste:** 8 numbers straight from Shopify (orders, AOV, return rate, shipping and handling costs).
**You get back:** the dollar figure returns cost you per year, split into its 4 leaks, plus a 3-move rescue plan ranked by recovered dollars.
**Time:** about 2 minutes in any Claude chat. Every figure shows its arithmetic.

Part of the RISE DTC AI Kit, RISE Method, Financial Health pillar.

## What this does

You give Claude eight numbers from your own Shopify data. Claude runs the
math in front of you, sizes your annual return-related dollar leak, tells
you which of three tiers you're in, and writes a 3-move rescue plan ordered
by which move recovers the most money first. Every dollar in the output
traces back to a number you gave it or to one named public benchmark. This
works as a Claude Code skill or pasted straight into a Claude chat: same
inputs, same math, same output.

## Step 1: Collect these eight inputs

Ask for all eight before computing anything. Use these hints verbatim if the
founder is unsure where to find a number:

| Field | What it is | Where to find it |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly orders | Orders in the last 30 days | Shopify, Analytics, Orders |
| AOV | Average order value ($) | Total sales divided by orders, on your Shopify overview |
| Return rate | Returns divided by orders, last 90 days (%) | Shopify, Analytics, Returns |
| Category | apparel / footwear / skincare and beauty / other DTC | Steers the plan copy only, not the math |
| Top return reason | sizing/fit, quality defect, not as described, changed mind, arrived damaged, other | Whichever reason is tagged most on your return requests |
| Exchange share | Of every 10 returns, how many become an exchange instead of a refund (%) | Rough is fine |
| Outbound shipping per order ($) | What you pay to ship one order out | A returned order already spent this, it never comes back |
| Return handling cost ($ per return) | Your cost to take one return back: label if you pay it, warehouse time, inspection, restock | Estimate from your own ops, no public figure is reliable enough to fill this in for you |

## Step 2: Compute the leak

Constants (the only two fixed rates in this whole model):

```
p = 0.029   f = 0.30     (published card processing rate, Shopify Payments / Stripe standard)
```

Convert inputs: `N` = monthly orders, `A` = AOV, `r` = return rate / 100,
`x` = exchange share / 100, `s` = outbound shipping, `h` = return handling.

Leak per returned order:

```
L_per_return = (1 - x)*A + s + (1 - x)*(p*A + f) + h
```

Monthly and annual totals:

```
Monthly_leak = N * r * L_per_return
Annual_leak  = 12 * Monthly_leak
```

Break the annual leak into its four components (show all four, this is what
ranks the plan):

```
Refunded revenue (annual)       = 12 * N * r * (1-x) * A
Sunk outbound shipping (annual) = 12 * N * r * s
Lost processing fees (annual)   = 12 * N * r * (1-x) * (p*A + f)
Return handling (annual)        = 12 * N * r * h
```

These four must add up to `Annual_leak`. Show the check.

Revenue kept by exchanges (not a cost line, state it as retained revenue):

```
Exchange_offset_annual = 12 * N * r * x * A
```

Recoverable slice, anchored to the one external figure in this whole model,
NRF and Happy Returns, 2024 Consumer Returns in the Retail Industry: US
retailers estimate 16.9% of annual sales get returned, all channels
combined. That is the floor, never a target below your current rate:

```
r_target = min(r, 0.169)
Recoverable_annual   = 12 * N * (r - r_target) * L_per_return
Residual_leak_annual = 12 * N * r_target * L_per_return
```

If the founder's rate is already at or under 16.9%, `Recoverable_annual = 0`.
Say so plainly, and point the plan at the exchange mix and handling cost
instead of the rate.

Leak as a share of revenue (this drives the tier):

```
Annual_revenue = 12 * N * A
Leak_pct = Annual_leak / Annual_revenue
```

## Step 3: Name the tier

```
Leak_pct < 8%          -> SLOW LEAK
8% <= Leak_pct < 16%   -> STEADY DRAIN
Leak_pct >= 16%        -> OPEN DRAIN
```

## Step 4: Write the 3-move plan

Rank the four leak components (Refunded revenue, Return handling, Sunk
outbound shipping, Lost processing fees) largest annual dollar figure first.
Output in this exact shape:

```
[tier name], you're leaking $[Annual_leak]/yr, [Leak_pct]% of revenue.

[One line naming the #1 driver by name and its annual dollar figure.]

1. [Component #1 name], $[annual figure]/yr. [One concrete action tied to
   category and top return reason, doable this week.]
2. [Component #2 name], $[annual figure]/yr. [Same.]
3. [Component #3 name], $[annual figure]/yr. [Same.]

If this lands: you recover $[Recoverable_annual]/yr and the leak drops to
$[Residual_leak_annual]/yr.

Your exchange rate already keeps $[Exchange_offset_annual]/yr that a
refund-only policy would lose.
```

Concrete-action examples by top return reason (adapt to the store's
category, don't invent a dollar figure for them): sizing/fit, add a fit
guide and per-product size chart to the three highest-return SKUs. quality
defect, pull the return notes on the top 3 returned SKUs and open a supplier
ticket. arrived damaged, photograph a week of damaged returns and switch the
worst SKU to protective mailers. not as described, rewrite the product copy
and photos on the top 3 returned SKUs against what customers say in the
return note. changed mind, tighten the pre-purchase expectation (sizing
quiz, comparison chart) at the point where changed-mind returns originate.

## Hard rules

- Never state a number that isn't computed from the founder's own inputs or
  the NRF 16.9% figure above. No invented benchmarks, no rounding tricks, no
  "industry average" claims beyond that one citation.
- Show the arithmetic. The founder should be able to check every figure by
  hand.
- No em dashes.
- No corrective-contrast phrasing: no "isn't X, it's Y," no "not just X,"
  no "X, not Y."
- Never use: leverage, seamless, robust, elevate, unlock, delve, streamline,
  empower, game-changer, transformative.
- Dollars first, always. Lead every line with the number, not the framing.
- Plain operator tone. Active voice, concrete nouns, no hype, no sign-off.
